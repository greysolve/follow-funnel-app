We are seeking a Senior Product Manager - Tech to lead the Identity and Household Management strategy for our music streaming platform. This is a high-impact opportunity at the intersection of identity, personalization, and shared listening experiences, where you'll solve some of the most complex challenges in the streaming space. You will define how customers manage their profiles, share access, and enjoy seamless, secure, and personalized experiences — whether they’re listening solo or with family.

In this role, you'll partner with Engineering, Data Science, Design, and other Product teams to build identity systems that scale across millions of users. You will shape the long-term vision for identity and household management, balancing privacy, access control, and personalization. You are customer-obsessed and highly analytical. You dive deep into data, map customer journeys, and spot points of friction — then build intuitive solutions that remove those barriers.

We are seeking a Senior Product Manager - Tech to lead the Identity and Household Management strategy for our music streaming platform. This role puts you at the forefront of redefining how families engage with music — across individual and shared experiences, spanning personal devices and communal ones like Alexa.

You’ll own the strategy and execution of new identity journeys that reflect the needs of listeners of all ages, from kids to adults, ensuring that every profile feels personal, secure, and seamless — whether it's being used on a tablet, phone, or a shared smart speaker.

In this role, you’ll collaborate with Engineering, Data Science, Design, and other Product teams to shape the next generation of household music experiences. You are customer-obsessed, deeply curious, and highly data-driven. You thrive in ambiguity and enjoy making the complex feel simple. You use data and research to identify friction points and proactively create solutions that empower families to listen the way they want — with the right level of control, personalization, and flexibility.

This is an opportunity to define and build identity systems from the ground up — systems that go beyond account-based access and instead deliver contextual, intuitive, and delightful experiences for everyone in the home.

Key job responsibilities

As a Sr. Product Manager - Technical on the Identity and Household Management team, you will:

 Define and drive the roadmap for identity and household experiences across our music streaming platform. Design new identity journeys that adapt to different family members and use cases — including personalized profiles for children, teens, and adults, and shared experiences on devices like Alexa. Build mechanisms that allow families to seamlessly switch between users and contexts, balancing personalization, simplicity, and privacy. Partner closely with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, privacy-conscious solutions that unlock new listening scenarios. Use customer insights, behavioral data, and experimentation to guide decision-making and optimize experiences. Think big about how identity can become a growth driver — increasing engagement, retention, and satisfaction across diverse user groups. Serve as the voice of the customer and represent diverse household needs in technical and strategic discussions.

A day in the life

As the Sr. Product Manager for Identity and Household Management, your day is a dynamic mix of strategy, problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration. You might start by diving into metrics to uncover friction in the profile setup flow, then join a design session to refine how families switch users on shared devices like Alexa. You work closely with engineering to evaluate backend architecture for household roles, and align with stakeholders across Legal, Trust, and Content to ensure compliance and delight. You regularly synthesize customer research, write product docs, and shape experiments that balance personalization, privacy, and usability — all while keeping the diverse needs of families at the center of every decision.

About The Team

We solve multi-user, multi-device challenges at scale — from kids discovering their favorite songs on a tablet, to parents using Alexa to play dinner playlists, to teens curating their own personalized feeds.

We’re reimagining identity not just as access control, but as a framework for inclusive, personalized, and delightful family engagement — across mobile and voice. Our work spans profile creation, switching, household roles, and listening controls, and supports both individual and shared use cases.

The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.

We are hiring an Engineering Manager for IAM (Identity and Access Management) to build high-performing Go and Python services and secure identity and access management solutions that will be used across all company products. From Ubuntu One SSO to Juju, LXD and MAAS your team will define the way Canonical users, clients and community members access their favorite open source applications.

This is an opportunity for a software engineering manager with a passion for distributed systems operations to help us transform the future of identity management at Canonical. Experience in the identity and access management (IAM) field is desirable but not required. You will work with upstream open source projects, alongside internal teams to deliver high quality software that can be deployed on bare metal, public cloud and Kubernetes.

As the identity team engineering manager you will bring significant software development experience, Kubernetes knowledge and a keen eye for software design, performance and security. You will be responsible for working with product management to define the technical vision for the products, managing the team backlog, reviewing code and coaching younger team members.

You will also be involved in all the aspects of the software development process: you will design software, write high-quality code and tests, provide insightful code reviews, write documentation and help to troubleshoot issues.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.

We are hiring an Engineering Manager for IAM (Identity and Access Management) to build high-performing Go and Python services and secure identity and access management solutions that will be used across all company products. From Ubuntu One SSO to Juju, LXD and MAAS your team will define the way Canonical users, clients and community members access their favorite open source applications.

This is an opportunity for a software engineering manager with a passion for distributed systems operations to help us transform the future of identity management at Canonical. Experience in the identity and access management (IAM) field is desirable but not required. You will work with upstream open source projects, alongside internal teams to deliver high quality software that can be deployed on bare metal, public cloud and Kubernetes.

As the identity team engineering manager you will bring significant software development experience, Kubernetes knowledge and a keen eye for software design, performance and security. You will be responsible for working with product management to define the technical vision for the products, managing the team backlog, reviewing code and coaching younger team members.

You will also be involved in all the aspects of the software development process: you will design software, write high-quality code and tests, provide insightful code reviews, write documentation and help to troubleshoot issues.

In addition to the engineering behind the project itself, you'll have the chance to work with industry-leading teams inside Canonical, ensuring your work is backed by rock-solid data stores, and highly observable using our Kubernetes-based Observability stack.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
